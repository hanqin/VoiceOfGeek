===========
There are so many open source projects by twers, most of them are very helpful resources. 

However, these resources are scattered, very few of them got noticed except the owner.

The goal is to build an application that would be installed on android tvs like LeshiTV and xiaomin, to broadcast information like the most recent events, recommended projects and so on.

And to encourage office level (*even accross offices*) knowledge sharing.
